/**
 * Implemented as a class so the engine logic lives on the prototype (one shared
 * copy) and each instance holds only data — the per-machine footprint is flat in
 * field/state count (no per-field reactive cell, no per-instance closure tree).
 * The reactivity kernel is a tiny coarse bus: a write (context or state change)
 * bumps `version` and notifies every listener; `select` re-evaluates + value-compares
 * so it fires only on a real change (O(changed) at the listener), and `computed`
 * memoizes by snapshotting the inputs it actually read (see ./computed).
