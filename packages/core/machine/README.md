# `@render-experiment/machine-core`

A tiny, **renderer-agnostic state-machine engine** for building UI component
logic once and running it anywhere. It owns _behavior_ — states, transitions,
side-effects, derived state — and knows nothing about the render environment.

It's pure JavaScript: it runs in any JS runtime (browser, Node, the React
Native JS thread), but not in native platform code (e.g. Swift/Kotlin).

```ts
import { machine, act } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

const toggle = machine({
  initial: 'inactive',
  context: { count: 0 },
  states: {
    inactive: {
      on: {
        flip: { target: 'active', actions: act($ => ({ count: $.context.count + 1 })) },
      },
    },
    active: {
      on: { flip: { target: 'inactive' } },
    },
  },
})

toggle.start()
toggle.send({ type: 'flip' })
toggle.state // 'active'
toggle.context.count // 1
```

That machine is the whole behavior. To render it, a target adds two thin steps —
and **the machine itself never changes**:

1. **`connect()`** turns machine state into _logical_ bindings — `onPress`, `role`,
   `describedBy`.
2. **`normalize`** translates those to real props per platform — `onClick` +
   `aria-*` on web, `Pressable` props on React Native.

## The trade-off

This is a focused engine, not a do-everything statechart. It leaves out, on
purpose:

- **Nested / parallel / hierarchical states** — flat states + composition instead.
- **Serializable-snapshot features** — time-travel, persistence, a visual inspector.
- **Spawned child machines / actors.**

**Need those? Reach for XState.** Driving many lightweight UI machines you never
serialize? You're not paying for capabilities you don't use. The full
side-by-side — what's shared, what differs, and the measured numbers — is below.

## How it compares

Anyone who has reached for [XState](https://stately.ai/docs) or
[Zag](https://zagjs.com/) will feel at home — same statechart vocabulary
(`states`, `transitions`, `guards`, `actions`, `effects`), same headless
philosophy. Those libraries are excellent; this one exists for two things they
aren't built around: **no environment assumption** (Zag is framework-agnostic but
presumes a DOM) and **performance under heavy fan-out**.

**Shared baseline:**

| Capability                     | Zag        | XState            | machine-core  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| States / transitions / guards  | ✅         | ✅                | ✅            |
| Guard combinators (and/or/not) | ✅         | ✅                | ✅            |
| `entry` / `exit`               | ✅         | ✅                | ✅            |
| Conditional actions            | `choose`   | `choose`          | `oneOf`       |
| Effects with cleanup           | `effects`¹ | invoked callbacks | `effects`     |
| Computed / derived             | ✅         | ✅                | ✅            |
| Timed transitions (`after`)    | ✅         | ✅                | ✅            |
| Watch (react to a data change) | `watch`    | via `always`      | `watch`       |
| Per-platform late binding      | ✅         | via `.provide()`  | `effects.ts`  |

- **¹ `effects`** is the same idea in Zag and here, but Zag's effects receive a `scope` (a DOM)
  and reach for it; ours receive no environment.

**The differences:** The single
cause underneath all of them is **how each engine holds a machine's data**.
This lib keeps context as **one plain object per machine, mutated in place**
(copied once at construction; its identity never changes) + a tiny notifier — no
per-field reactive cell (Zag), no immutable snapshot per event (XState).

| What's different                | Zag                          | XState                       | machine-core                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| State selection                 | ❌ host framework does it    | ⚠️ `actor.select` (coarse)   | 🟢 `select` (fine-grained)            |
| Runs with no host framework     | ❌ needs a framework         | ⚠️ statechart yes            | 🟢 yes                                |
| Flat-ish state memory           | ❌ a reactive cell per field | 🟢 plain snapshot            | 🟢 plain context (one object/machine) |
| Data model                      | reactive cell per field      | immutable snapshot per event | one plain object, mutated in place    |
| Serializable snapshot¹          | ❌ state too scattered       | 🟢 the actor model           | ⚠️ no built-in                        |
| Nested / hierarchical states    | ❌ by design²                | ✅                           | ❌ flat                               |
| Parallel state                  | ❌ by design²                | ✅                           | ⚠️ `compose` (peers, no shared event) |
| Spawned child machines / actors | ❌ by design²                | ✅                           | ❌ by design²                         |

- **XState** allocates a serializable snapshot on every transition, and it taxes the hot
  path. machine-core drops mutates in place.
- **Zag** can run framework-free, but presumes a host DOM framework, machine-core owns
  its reactivity internally, extending the same idea onto any JS enviroment (DOM, React Native, TUI, WebGL, ...).
- **¹ Serializable snapshot** — only XState ships it (actor model). machine-core can
  add one (context is one plain object); Zag can't easily (state is scattered React
  hook cells).
- **² ❌-by-design** keep machines light-weight, avoid the heavy statechart concepts.

### Performance

Numbers below are from `pnpm benchmark` (Node 24, single clean run) — **disposable
first-look** figures, reproduce them yourself. The root
[README](../../../README.md#fast-at-scale) carries the headline summary; this
section is the per-scenario detail. Contenders are `machine-core` and
XState in the synchronous ops/sec loops (both sync statecharts, fair); Zag's
headless `send` is async (microtask-batched), so it can't share a synchronous
loop — it appears where it runs synchronously: construction, memory, and the
React render arena (mount + re-render row-count).

### Benchmark

#### Overview

|                                 | **Agnostic Render** |  XState |        Zag |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------: | ------: | ---------: |
| **Events per second**           |         **3.0 M/s** | 850 K/s |      n/a ¹ |
| **Spin up 10 000 machines**     |               30 ms |   24 ms |      98 ms |
| **Memory at 64 fields/machine** |              4.7 KB |  4.1 KB | **134 KB** |
| **Bundle** (min + gzip)         |          **2.2 KB** | 15.8 KB |   0.5 KB ² |
| **Bundle** + React adapter      |          **3.0 KB** | 18.6 KB |     3.6 KB |
| **Render 1 000 rows** (mount)   |          **5.4 ms** |  5.9 ms |     5.7 ms |
| **Re-render after a change** ³  |          **3.8 ms** |  7.0 ms |      n/a ¹ |

Where the engine decisively wins is the hot path (~3.5× XState's event
throughput) and per-field-cell memory (Zag's 64-field context is ~28× core's).
Construction and memory against XState are roughly par — core's bet there is
_flatness_, not a headline win.

- ¹ Zag's `send` is async (microtask-batched), so it can't share a **synchronous** loop — neither the events/sec throughput nor the `flushSync` re-render timing. It IS measured where it runs sync: construction + memory (headless `VanillaMachine`), mount, and the re-render row-count (it wakes only 2 rows, same as the others — see the render table below).
- ² Zag's `@zag-js/core` is config-only (the machine runtime lives in the framework adapter), so its 0.5 KB engine row isn't runnable on its own — the `+ React adapter` row (`@zag-js/react`) is the fair comparison.
- ³ Each library using its idiomatic fine-grained path (Agnostic Render & Zag: per-instance machine + `React.memo`; XState: shared actor + `@xstate/react`'s `useSelector`).

#### In depth analyzis

**Throughput — events/sec (higher is better)**

| Scenario                          | machine-core | XState |
| --------------------------------- | -----------: | -----: |
| Single machine, one event         |   **3.02 M** | 0.85 M |
| Fine-grain (unobserved) 1 of 5000 |   **1.20 M** | 0.45 M |

**Construction — µs / machine, and memory — KB / machine (5 000 live; lower is better)**

Construction is synchronous for all three, so Zag's headless `VanillaMachine` is a
fair contender here (and for memory). All engines share one module-level config
across instances — the shape a real app has:

| Metric                        | machine-core | XState |     Zag |
| ----------------------------- | -----------: | -----: | ------: |
| Construct (µs/machine, ×10 K) |         3.04 |   2.42 |    9.82 |
| Memory, 2-field context       |         4.23 |   3.61 |    9.06 |
| Memory, 64-field context      |         4.73 |   4.09 | **134** |

(Memory rows are the _written_ mode — every machine received one event, the
footprint a real app pays. XState is marginally lighter per machine; core's
claim here is flatness, not the smallest absolute number.)

2 → 64 fields adds only ~0.5 KB/machine for core: context is one plain object,
so memory grows with the data you store, not with a per-field cell. It's not
perfectly flat — it grows linearly, just slowly. **Zag is the contrast that makes
the point**: its context is one reactive cell per field, so 64 fields balloon to
~134 KB/machine (~28×) — the per-field-cell cost this model avoids.

**Idle vs written.** Each core machine copies the config's context once at
construction and mutates it in place forever (the object's identity never
changes — that's what lets effects and actions hold live references safely). So
core's idle and written footprints are the same number by design, while a
lazy-copy scheme shows a step once writes start:

| Metric (64 fields, 5 000 machines) | machine-core | XState | Zag |
| ---------------------------------- | -----------: | -----: | --: |
| Idle (never written)               |         4.72 |   3.55 | 130 |
| Written (1 event each)             |         4.73 |   4.09 | 134 |

Core idle ≡ written; XState's first `assign` allocates a per-actor context, so
its written row grows. (An earlier copy-on-write scheme in core shared the
config's context until the first write — measured honestly, that sharing saved
~40 B per idle machine on a component-sized context and ~0.5 KB at 64 fields,
and its one-time reference swap silently stranded any context reference captured
before the first write. Owning the copy from birth was the better trade.)

**React rendering — list of 1 000 rows, 50 highlight moves.** Each library in its
idiomatic fine-grained path (lower is better):

| Metric                | machine-core | XState |          Zag |
| --------------------- | -----------: | -----: | -----------: |
| Rows woken / move     |        **2** |      2 |            2 |
| Mount (ms) ³          |      **5.4** |    5.9 |          5.7 |
| Re-render wall (ms) ¹ |      **3.8** |    7.0 | n/a (async)² |

All three properly-set-up engines wake only the **2** rows that changed. The
difference is per-render _cost_ — where core and XState are directly comparable
(both flush synchronously); Zag's async send can't be timed under the same
`flushSync` loop, but its **row-count is identical** (2), which is the metric
that matters for "does it stay surgical at scale."

- ¹ 50 highlight moves, median of 5.
- ² Zag's `send` is microtask-batched, so a
  synchronous `flushSync` re-render loop can't time it fairly (it balloons under
  forced sync flushes) — only the row-count is reported for Zag.
- ³ Mount (ms) is **not** apples-to-apples: each library mounts its idiomatic
  per-row primitive (core/XState a `useSelector` subscription; Zag a full
  `useMachine` + `React.memo` wrapper). It's "cost of this library's row", not a
  shared primitive — the row-count and re-render wall are the comparable metrics.

**When this matters: density × frequency** — many machines reacting to a
high-frequency stream inside one frame budget. Trading terminals (thousands of
ticker rows), canvas boards (`pointermove` fanning out to selected shapes),
monitoring walls, multiplayer editors, game HUDs. Where machine work fights the
frame, ~3.6× throughput plus surgical re-renders is the difference between smooth
and dropped frames.

### The machine never sees props

A machine here is pure behavior — it has no `props` argument and no `prop()`
accessor, so the _same_ machine runs byte-for-byte identically on every target.
This is the engine's defining rule, and the one place it diverges from Zag/XState
(whose machines read props directly). The full rationale + the layered model live
in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md#the-core-rule-the-machine-never-sees-props);
the engine-level summary: every job a prop does lands at the **edge**, never the
machine —

| A prop that…            | …goes here                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **configures** behavior | seeded into `context` once (and updated via `setContext`)                                                        |
| **fires a callback**    | a **reaction** on the connector (see [Reactions](#reactions--firing-prop-callbacks-without-the-machine-knowing)) |
| **is controlled** state | resolved into the initial state before `machine()` is built                                                      |

## Lifecycle

`machine(config)` returns a **service** that is _built but not running_. The
caller controls when it boots:

```ts
const m = machine(config)
m.start() // boot it (effects + watchers begin)
m.stop() // tear down (cleanups run); restartable with start()
```

The lifecycle lives on the instance so every target drives it the same way —
React calls them in `useEffect`, a test inline. The shared teardown logic is
written once. `send()` still works while stopped (transitions are pure state);
only side-effects are gated by `start`/`stop`.

**`onStart` / `onStop`** let an _outer_ layer hang start/stop-scoped work off the
machine's lifecycle without the machine knowing what it is — this is how the
connector wires its [reactions](#reactions--firing-prop-callbacks-without-the-machine-knowing)
on boot and tears them down on stop. They fire on _every_ start/stop (a machine
can restart), so listeners must be idempotent; `onStart` also runs immediately if
the machine is already running, so a late registrant never misses it. Each
returns an unregister.

```ts
const offStart = m.onStart(() => {
  /* start-scoped wiring */
})
const offStop = m.onStop(() => {
  /* teardown */
})
```

> **Tip: author configs with `setup()`.** Writing a config as a bare object gives
> weaker type-checking than authoring it through `setup()`, which applies the full
> `TransitionConfig` constraint at the definition site. Two paths off one call:
>
> ```ts
> import { setup, machine } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'
>
> // lightweight — infers State / Context / Event from the literal, names loose:
> const cfg = setup().createMachine({ initial: 'closed', context: {}, states: { closed: {} } })
>
> // checked — name a registry, then every guard/action/effect/delay reference in
> // the config is compile-checked + autocompleted against its keys (typo = error):
> const { createMachine } = setup<Ctx, Ev>().config({
>   guards: { isOpen: ({ context }) => context.open },
> })
> const checked = createMachine({
>   initial: 'closed',
>   context: { open: false },
>   states: { closed: { on: { toggle: { target: 'open', guard: 'isOpen' } } }, open: {} },
> })
>
> const m = machine(cfg)
> ```

## Context — reactive data

`context` is the component's data. It's **read** as a plain property and
**written** through `setContext` (a single, batched entry point):

```ts
const m = machine({
  initial: 'idle',
  context: { name: 'Ada', age: 36 },
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: {
        birthday: { actions: $ => $.setContext({ age: $.context.age + 1 }) },
      },
    },
  },
})

m.context.name // 'Ada'
m.send({ type: 'birthday' })
m.context.age // 37
```

---

## States & transitions

Each state lists the events it responds to under `on`. A transition can change
state (`target`), run `actions`, or both:

```ts
const light = machine({
  initial: 'green',
  context: {},
  states: {
    green: { on: { next: { target: 'yellow' } } },
    yellow: { on: { next: { target: 'red' } } },
    red: { on: { next: { target: 'green' } } },
  },
})

light.start()
light.send({ type: 'next' }) // green → yellow
```

**Any-state events** go in the top-level `on` (a per-state `on` wins over it):

```ts
on: { reset: { target: 'a' } }, // works from ANY state
```

**Tags** group states so consumers ask about a _category_, not a name:

```ts
states: {
  closed: {},
  opening: { tags: ['visible'] },
  open: { tags: ['visible'] },
}
m.hasTag('visible') // true while in opening OR open
m.matches('open') // exact-state check
```

**Events are queued (run-to-completion).** If an action sends another event, it
waits until the current transition fully finishes — no re-entrancy surprises:

```ts
states: {
  a: { on: { go: { target: 'b', actions: [({ send }) => send({ type: 'auto' })] } } },
  b: { on: { auto: { target: 'c' } } }, // 'auto' processes AFTER the machine settles in 'b'
  c: {},
}
```

---

## Guards — gating a transition

A guard is a predicate; return `false` and the transition doesn't fire. It
receives `{ context, event, computed }`:

```ts
on: { submit: { target: 'done', guard: ({ context }) => context.allowed } }
```

**Fallthrough** — give an event an _array_ of transitions; the first whose guard
passes wins:

```ts
on: {
  tick: [
    { guard: ({ context }) => context.n >= 10, target: 'max' },
    { guard: ({ context }) => context.n > 0, target: 'some' },
    { target: 'zero' }, // no guard = fallback
  ],
}
```

**Named guards + combinators** (`and` / `or` / `not`):

```ts
import { and, not } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

machine({
  // ...
  states: {
    idle: { on: { toggle: { target: 'busy', guard: and('isOpen', not('isLocked')) } } },
  },
  implementations: {
    guards: {
      isOpen: ({ context }) => context.open,
      isLocked: ({ context }) => context.locked,
    },
  },
})
```

---

## Actions — fire-and-forget side-effects

Actions run on a transition, in order, getting
`{ context, setContext, event, send, computed }`. Inline or named:

```ts
on: {
  save: {
    actions: [
      $ => $.setContext({ saved: true }),
      'notify', // a named action from implementations.actions
    ],
  },
}
```

**`act(...)`** is write-sugar for the most common action — setting context. It
drops the `$ => $.setContext(...)` wrapper, so the patch reads as data, and takes
one or many patches (applied in order; a later patch fn sees earlier writes):

```ts
import { act } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

on: {
  save: {
    actions: [
      act({ saved: true }), // ≡ $ => $.setContext({ saved: true })
      'notify',
    ],
  },
  // one or many fields, static or derived:
  bump: { actions: act({ touched: true }, $ => ({ n: $.context.n + 1 })) },
}
```

`act` only WRITES — `target` / `guard` stay on the transition object. It returns
a normal action, so it slots in any `actions` / `entry` / `exit` list or a `oneOf`
branch.

**`entry` / `exit`** run when a state is entered / left — handy for behavior that
should run on _any_ way in or out, without repeating it on each transition:

```ts
states: {
  open: {
    entry: ['focusFirstItem'], // on enter
    exit: ['restoreFocus'], // on leave
    on: { close: { target: 'closed' } },
  },
  closed: {},
}
```

**`oneOf`** picks one branch of actions by guard (the action analog of
fallthrough):

`oneOf(...)` is variadic — its branches are plain `{ guard?, actions }` objects
(the same shape as a transition, minus `target`); `actions` may be a single action
or a list. A guardless branch is the fallback (put it last):

```ts
import { oneOf } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

actions: [
  oneOf(
    { guard: 'isMobile', actions: 'lockScroll' },
    { guard: 'isDesktop', actions: 'dimBackground' },
    { actions: 'noop' }, // guardless = fallback
  ),
]
```

---

## Effects — side-effects with cleanup

An effect runs when a state is **entered** and returns an optional **cleanup**
that runs when the state is **left**. Setup and teardown share one closure — so
whatever an effect starts on enter is torn down by the exact cleanup that
captured it (something plain `entry`/`exit` can't do without manual bookkeeping):

```ts
states: {
  open: {
    // subscribe to a store while open; unsubscribe on exit. No platform, no props
    // — a pure effect, so it lives right here in the config.
    effects: [
      ({ context, send }) =>
        store.subscribe(() => {
          if (store.get().openId !== context.id) send({ type: 'close' })
        }),
    ],
    on: { close: { target: 'closed' } },
  },
  closed: {},
}
```

The current state's effects boot on `start()` (the initial state's, on a fresh
machine); all active cleanups run on `stop()`. Effects can be named and resolved
from `implementations.effects` (so they're reusable / overridable) or written
inline.

### Where does a side-effect live? — the two homes

Not every side-effect belongs in the config. The deciding question is **does it
touch the platform** (a DOM listener, a native API) and **does it need props**
(the machine [never sees props](#the-machine-never-sees-props)). That gives two
homes:

```
Is the effect props-free AND platform-free?
|
+-- Yes -> a plain machine effect, in the config `effects`
|          (e.g. a store subscription -- same on every target,
|           runs in the machine scoped to a state)
|
+-- No  -> a ComponentEffect in the target's effects.ts -- the VIEW owns it
           (prop-aware and/or platform-specific: a DOM keydown for Escape,
            RN BackHandler; run by the view via `useEffects`)
```

| Home                       | Owns the lifecycle | Touches platform | Reads props |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| config `effects: { … }`    | machine            | no               | no          |
| `ComponentEffect` (target) | the view           | yes              | yes/no      |

A config effect is props-free and platform-free, so it's identical on every
target — a store subscription is the canonical case. Anything that touches the
platform (a DOM `keydown` for Escape, the RN `BackHandler`) or reads a prop
(`closeOnEscape`) lives in the target's `effects.ts` as a `ComponentEffect`, run
by the view via `useEffects`. The machine never sees it; the effect just `send()`s
a plain event the machine already handles.

---

## Computed — derived data

Computeds are values _derived_ from context (or other computeds). Lazy and
memoized: a computed recalculates only when an input it actually read changes.

```ts
const m = machine({
  initial: 'idle',
  context: { items: ['a', 'b'] },
  computed: {
    count: ({ context }) => context.items.length,
    isEmpty: ({ computed }) => computed.count === 0, // derives from another computed
  },
  states: { idle: {} },
})

m.computed.count // 2
m.computed.isEmpty // false
```

Computeds are available everywhere context is — guards, actions, effects
(`{ ..., computed }`) — and on the machine itself (`m.computed.x`).

---

## `after` — timed transitions

A state can transition **automatically after a delay**. The timer is scoped to
the state: scheduled on enter, **auto-cancelled** if the state is left (or
`stop()` is called) before it fires.

```ts
const m = machine({
  initial: 'closed',
  context: { openMs: 200 },
  states: {
    closed: { on: { hover: { target: 'opening' } } },
    opening: { after: { openDelay: { target: 'open' } } }, // wait, then open
    open: { after: { 1500: { target: 'closed' } } }, // auto-dismiss after 1.5s
  },
  implementations: {
    delays: { openDelay: ({ context }) => context.openMs }, // named, dynamic delay
  },
})
```

A delay key is a **number of ms** (`1500`) or a **named delay** resolved from
`implementations.delays` (which can read `context`/`computed`, so it's dynamic).
An `after` entry is a normal transition: it can `target`, run `actions`, and use
guard fallthrough. A pure wait-then-advance state _is_ "sleep":

```ts
states: {
  flash: { after: { 300: { target: 'idle' } } }, // show for 300ms, then return
}
```

---

## `watch` — react to data changes

Where `after` reacts to _time_ and effects react to _state_, `watch` reacts to
**data**: run actions whenever a context (or computed) field changes — in any
state, for the machine's whole lifetime.

```ts
const m = machine({
  initial: 'idle',
  context: { query: '' },
  watch: {
    query: ['runSearch'], // whenever `query` changes → runSearch
  },
  states: { idle: {} },
  implementations: {
    actions: { runSearch: ({ context, send }) => send({ type: 'search', q: context.query }) },
  },
})
```

The declarative form of "subscribe to a field and run something." Watchers start
on `start()`, clean up on `stop()`, and fire only when the watched field's value
actually changes (not on setup). Watch actions obey the same
**run-to-completion** rule as events: they're queued and run after the
transition that changed the field fully settles (never mid-transition), so they
always observe the whole write, and a watcher writing context can't re-enter the
transition in flight. Use `watch` for side-effecting reactions; for a _derived
value_, reach for `computed` instead.

---

## Subscriptions — observing changes

**Coarse** `subscribe` wakes on _any_ change (what a `useSyncExternalStore`
bridge uses):

```ts
const off = m.subscribe(() => rerender()) // fires on any state/context change
off() // unsubscribe
```

It fires on any `setContext` or state change. A computed change is covered
transitively (a computed only changes when context it reads changes), so "any
change" holds in practice.

**Fine-grained** `select` narrows to a slice and fires _only when that slice's
value changes_:

```ts
// a single named field (typed + autocompleted):
m.select.context('count').subscribe(n => console.log('count is now', n))
m.select.computed('isEmpty').subscribe(empty => toggle(empty))
m.select.state().subscribe(s => console.log('state →', s))

// or a derived/composite selection via a function:
const view = m.select(() => ({ open: m.matches('open'), count: m.context.count }))
view.subscribe(render, (a, b) => a.open === b.open && a.count === b.count) // optional equality
view.value // read the current selected value directly
```

A `select` re-evaluates on any machine change but only fires its listener when the
selected value actually changes — so an observer wakes only for the slice it reads.

---

## Connector — the view boundary

A component's pure `connect(snapshot) → api` maps machine state into a
view-facing object (handlers + attributes a renderer spreads onto elements). The
`connector` keeps that mapping **live** and hands the renderer a stable,
subscribable snapshot:

```ts
import { connector } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

const connect = ({ state, send }) => ({
  isOpen: state === 'open',
  triggerProps: { onPress: () => send({ type: 'toggle' }) },
})

const c = connector(m, connect, /* initial props */ {})

c.snapshot // memoized api; identity is stable until something changes
c.subscribe(rerender) // coarse — wake the view
c.select // forwarded fine-grained path
c.setProps(newProps) // props are a reactive input; recomputes the snapshot
```

`setProps` is **shallow-dedup'd**: passing a fresh-but-equal props object (the
common case — a host that rebuilds props every render) is a no-op, so it won't
needlessly recompute the snapshot or wake subscribers. Only a real value change
propagates.

The connector surface is exactly these four: `snapshot`, `subscribe`, `select`,
`setProps`. Prop-callbacks ([reactions](#reactions--firing-prop-callbacks-without-the-machine-knowing))
are wired **automatically** off the machine's own lifecycle — there's nothing to
activate by hand.

`c.snapshot`'s identity changes only when the machine (or props) changes — so it
drops straight into React's `useSyncExternalStore(c.subscribe, () => c.snapshot)`
without the infinite-loop / tearing pitfalls of returning a fresh object each
read.

> **Why `connect` returns abstract handlers (`onPress`) and not `onClick`:** core
> stays renderer-blind. A per-target `normalize` step translates the agnostic
> _bindings_ vocabulary (`onPress`, `role`, `describedBy`) into real props
> (`onClick`, `aria-describedby`) — so the same `connect` can target the DOM,
> React Native, or any other surface.

### Reactions — firing prop-callbacks without the machine knowing

Because [the machine never sees props](#the-machine-never-sees-props),
a callback like `onOpenChange` can't fire from inside it. A **reaction** is how
the connector bridges that gap from the _outside_: a declared
`[selector, callback]` tuple that watches a value derived from machine state
and, when it changes, calls the matching prop. (Same tuple shape as a React
`ComponentEffect` — declare each as a named const, collect them in a list.)

```ts
import { makeReaction } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

// fix the machine generics once per component; `Value` is then inferred per reaction:
const reaction = makeReaction<TooltipState, TooltipContext, TooltipEvent, TooltipProps>()

const onOpenChange = reaction(
  m => m.matches('open') || m.matches('closing'), // selector → Value inferred as boolean
  (open, props) => props.onOpenChange?.({ open }), // callback: open is boolean, no annotation
)

connectTooltip.reactions = [onOpenChange]
```

`makeReaction(...)` is just an inference helper: it returns the same
`[selector, callback]` tuple, but recovers the selector→callback `Value` link a
bare array would lose (inline, the tuple lands in `Reaction<…, any>` and the
callback's first arg is untyped). The raw `Reaction<…>` tuple type still works if
you prefer to spell it out.

The machine just transitions `closed → open`; it has no idea `onOpenChange`
exists. The connector runs the selector (tuple position 0) as a value-deduped
`select(...)`, and when the result flips it calls the callback (position 1) with
the **current** props (so a swapped callback is always the one that fires). This
is the inversion from Zag, for example, which fires the same callback as an
`invokeOnOpen` _action inside_ the machine — here the firing is pulled out to the
edge, which is what keeps the machine pure.

`selector` is always a **function** (no state-name shorthand): it reads whatever
it needs off the machine — `m.matches('open')` for a state-based reaction, or
`m.context.highlightedValue` for a value-based one — so a single shape covers
every reaction whether it keys off state or context.

Reactions are **wired automatically** — there is no activation call. The
connector hooks the machine's own lifecycle (`onStart` / `onStop`), so reactions
come alive on `start()` and are torn down on `stop()`, exactly as long as the
machine runs. The bridge only drives the machine; reactions follow for free:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  service.start() // reactions wire themselves here (connector's onStart hook)
  return () => service.stop() // …and tear down here (onStop)
}, [service])
```

Hooking the machine's lifecycle (not the connector's construction) means a
restart — notably React StrictMode's mount→unmount→mount — cleanly
re-establishes the reactions with no bookkeeping in the bridge.

Contrast with the **target's effects**: a reaction is for pure state→callback
(portable, declared once, runs on every target). Anything needing the platform
itself — a DOM `keydown` listener for Escape — lives in the target's effect
layer (the React bridge's `ComponentEffect`), which gates it and then `send()`s a
plain event the machine already handles.

- reaction = agnostic edge (state → callback, every target)
- target effect = platform edge (DOM/RN listeners → `send()`)

---

## Composing machines

States are flat. When a component has **two independent dimensions of state at
once** — say a popup that's open/closed _and_ a submenu that's shown/hidden —
each dimension is its own machine, and `compose` runs them as one unit
(orthogonal regions, without nested states):

```ts
import { compose } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

const popup = machine({
  /* closed / open */
})
const submenu = machine({
  /* none / shown */
})

const combobox = compose({ popup, submenu })
combobox.start() // starts every member; .stop() stops all + disposes the helpers below

// members stay independent — drive and read each on its own:
popup.send({ type: 'focus' })
submenu.send({ type: 'open' }) // both regions active simultaneously
```

`compose` returns a `Composition` with two helpers, both auto-disposed on
`stop()`:

```ts
// sync — a cross-region rule: react when any member changes. COARSE: it wakes on
// any change to any member (the rule reads what it needs); use it for cross-region
// coordination, not as a fine-grained per-field watcher.
combobox.sync(() => {
  if (popup.matches('closed')) submenu.send({ type: 'close' })
})

// combine — one value-deduped Selection derived across members; re-evaluates on
// any member change and fires only when the combined value changes
const view = combobox.combine(() => ({ open: popup.matches('open'), sub: submenu.state }))
view.value // { open: true, sub: 'shown' }
view.subscribe(render)
```

This is the engine's answer to hierarchy/parallel statecharts: rather than
nesting states in one machine, compose independent peer machines. Each stays
individually observable (fine-grained `select` per region), and `compose` adds
only the lifecycle + coordination glue.

> **`compose` vs. true parallel states.** Members are independent peers: a
> `send` goes to one member, not broadcast across regions, and there's no shared
> event bus. Cross-region behavior is expressed explicitly via `sync`. That's the
> deliberate trade — simpler than nested/parallel statecharts, at the cost of a
> shared event model.

---

## Flat states & managing "nested" data

States here are **flat** — there's no hierarchy and no parallel regions inside a
single machine. That's a deliberate constraint, and the first reaction to it is
usually the same worry: _won't my states explode?_ Take a **combobox** (an input
with a filtered dropdown). It feels like it has many states at once: the popup is
open or closed, _and_ some item is highlighted (one of N), _and_ a value may be
selected. Treat each combination as its own state and you get the product —
`open/closed × N highlighted × selected/not` — which blows up the moment the list
grows.

It doesn't have to — because **the explosion only happens if you fold independent
things onto the single state axis.** A flat state should encode exactly **one**
axis of control flow (here: is the popup open?). Everything that would multiply
that axis is pushed sideways onto a different tool:

- a **product of data** → `computed`
- a **second lifecycle** → `compose`
- a **grouping over states** → `tags`

| You have…                                                 | Don't…                                  | Do…                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| A value derived from **data** (which item is highlighted) | make a state per item → N nodes         | keep the inputs in **`context`**, derive it in `computed` |
| A **second independent lifecycle** running at once        | multiply it into the popup states → N×M | run it as a peer with **`compose`**                       |
| A **category over many states** ("is the list showing?")  | `matches('a') \|\| matches('b') \|\| …` | tag the states, query with **`hasTag`**                   |

### A product of data → `computed`

"Which item is highlighted" isn't control flow — it's a value derived from the
query, the filtered list, and the active index. Those are `context` fields; the
highlighted item is a _derived_ value, not a state per row:

```ts
machine<
  'idle' | 'open',
  { query: string; items: Item[]; activeIndex: number },
  Event,
  {
    filtered: Item[]
    highlighted: Item | null
  }
>({
  initial: 'idle',
  context: { query: '', items: ALL_ITEMS, activeIndex: -1 },
  computed: {
    // derived, memoized — never a state per item
    filtered: $ => $.context.items.filter(i => i.label.includes($.context.query)),
    highlighted: $ => $.computed.filtered[$.context.activeIndex] ?? null,
  },
  states: {
    idle: { on: { focus: { target: 'open' } } },
    open: {
      on: {
        // a few handlers move the cursor / filter — NOT one transition per row
        type: act($ => ({ query: $.event.value, activeIndex: 0 })),
        moveDown: act($ => ({ activeIndex: $.context.activeIndex + 1 })),
        moveUp: act($ => ({ activeIndex: $.context.activeIndex - 1 })),
        close: { target: 'idle' },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**Two state nodes, not "one per item."** `highlighted` is recomputed lazily and
only when an input it read changes — so the transitions scale with the _kinds_ of
move (type / up / down), not with the list length.

### A second lifecycle → `compose`

If a second axis is genuine control flow — e.g. an **async loader** that fetches
the options (`idle → loading → loaded → error`) running _alongside_ the open/closed
popup — don't fold it into the popup machine (that's `popupStates × loaderStates`
nodes). Make it a peer region and [`compose`](#composing-machines) the two:

```ts
const combobox = compose({ popup: popupMachine, loader: loaderMachine })
// 2 popup + 4 loader states = 6 nodes total, not 2 × 4 = 8 — additive, not multiplicative
```

### A grouping over states → `tags`

Even flat, a machine accumulates states, and the view often wants a _category_:
"is the listbox visible right now?" — which may be true across several states.
Tagging keeps that query from scaling with the state count (see
[Tags](#states--transitions)):

```ts
states: {
  idle:     {},
  open:     { tags: ['expanded'] },
  filtering:{ tags: ['expanded'] },   // still showing the list, just narrowing it
}

m.hasTag('expanded') // true in open OR filtering — one query, no OR-chain
```

The throughline: flat states stay readable because the things that would have
multiplied them live elsewhere — data in `computed`, parallel lifecycles in
`compose`, categories in `tags`.

---

## `createStore` — cross-instance singleton state

Context lives _inside_ a machine. Some state belongs _outside_ any one machine —
a singleton shared across instances, like "only one tooltip open at a time" or "a
single active menu in a menubar." `createStore` is a tiny reactive cell for
exactly that: a plain value plus a listener set.

```ts
import { createStore } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

const store = createStore({ count: 0 })

store.get() // { count: 0 }
store.set({ count: 1 }) // shallow-merge a patch…
store.set(s => ({ count: s.count + 1 })) // …or an updater (no-op writes don't notify)
const off = store.subscribe(s => console.log(s.count)) // fires on change, not on subscribe
off()
```

Pass a second `build` argument to add named domain methods on top — no facade
boilerplate. `build` receives the base store, so the methods read/write through
it:

```ts
const tooltipStore = createStore({ openId: null as string | null }, s => ({
  setOpen: (id: string | null) => s.set({ openId: id }),
  isOpen: (id: string) => s.get().openId === id,
}))

tooltipStore.setOpen('a')
tooltipStore.isOpen('a') // true
```

The store is **not** wired into a machine's `select` automatically — reading
`store.get()` inside a `select` won't re-fire when the store changes. To make a
machine react to a shared store, bridge it explicitly: subscribe to the store and
forward the change as an event the machine already handles.

```ts
const off = tooltipStore.subscribe(s => m.send({ type: 'activeChanged', openId: s.openId }))
```

---

## Putting it together

```ts
import { setup, machine, connector } from '@render-experiment/machine-core'

// 1. describe behavior (agnostic) — setup() type-checks the literal in place.
//    Pure, props-free, platform-free, so it's the lightweight path.
const disclosureConfig = setup().createMachine({
  initial: 'closed',
  context: {},
  states: {
    closed: { on: { open: { target: 'open' } } },
    open: { on: { close: { target: 'closed' } } },
  },
})

// A platform listener — closing on the Escape key — would NOT live here:
// it touches the DOM (and is usually prop-gated), so it's a `ComponentEffect`
// in the target's effects.ts, which `send({ type: 'close' })`s the event above.

// 2. map to a view api
const connect = ({ state, send }) => ({
  isOpen: state === 'open',
  triggerProps: { onPress: () => send({ type: 'open' }) },
})

// 3. run it
const m = machine(disclosureConfig)
m.start()
const view = connector(m, connect, {})
view.subscribe(render)
```

| **setup**                        | The authoring entry point — `setup().createMachine(literal)` (lightweight, names loose) or `setup<Ctx,Ev>().config(registries).createMachine(config)` (names compile-checked). [→](#lifecycle)                                 |
| **state**                        | One of the flat, named situations the machine can be in (it's in exactly one at a time). [→](#states--transitions)                                                         |

| **fallthrough**                  | An array of transitions for one event; the first whose guard passes wins. [→](#guards--gating-a-transition)                                                                |
| **action**                       | A fire-and-forget side-effect run on a transition, in order — gets `{context,setContext,event,send,computed}`. [→](#actions--fire-and-forget-side-effects)                 |

| **effect**                       | A side-effect with cleanup, scoped to a state: runs on enter, its returned cleanup runs on exit. [→](#effects--side-effects-with-cleanup)                                  |
| **implementations**              | The named registry on a config — `guards` / `actions` / `effects` / `delays` referenced by string. [→](#guards--gating-a-transition)                                       |

| **connector**                    | Keeps `connect` live: memoizes the snapshot, makes props a reactive input, wires reactions. [→](#connector--the-view-boundary)                                             |

| **select**                       | Fine-grained observation — narrows to a slice, fires only when _that value_ changes. [→](#subscriptions--observing-changes)                                                |
