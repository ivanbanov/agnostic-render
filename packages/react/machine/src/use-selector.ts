/**
 * Fine-grained, selector-based subscription for leaf components.
 *
 * The selector reads from the machine directly (`m.context.x`, `m.matches(...)`)
 * and the component re-renders only when the selected VALUE changes — not on
 * every machine change.
 *
 * Mechanism (not field-level auto-tracking): the machine's `select` is a coarse
 * bus. Every selection re-evaluates its selector on each machine notify and
 * value-compares the result; the component is woken only when its selected
 * value actually changed. So the WORK done per machine change is O(selectors on
 * that machine) — each re-evaluates — but the React RE-RENDERS are O(selectors
 * whose value changed). For a leaf list backed by ONE machine per item (the
 * common shape), each item has a single selector on its own machine, so a
 * change wakes only that item. The deduping is what makes thousands of leaves
 * cheap; it is value-based, not dependency-graph based.
 *
 *   const open = useSelector(m, () => m.matches('open'))
 *   const isHL = useSelector(m, () => m.context.highlightedValue === value)
 *
 * Equality is `Object.is` by default; pass a custom `isEqual` for object
 * selections.
 *
 * The selector and isEqual are kept in refs and read through a STABLE inner
 * Selection, so a per-render-fresh `selector` (e.g. one closing over a `value`
 * prop) always evaluates its latest form WITHOUT re-creating the Selection or
 * re-subscribing every render. Only `m` changing rebuilds the subscription.
